# Contributing

Contributions are welcome!!

If you have found a bug or would like to see some feature added feel free to create an issue
or even better yet create a pull request.

Here are some simple guidelines for creating a PR:
- Please test your code
- For bugs, try and write a test to expose your bug first
- Create an issue for the work you are doing so others have some context on what the PR is trying to solve.

Values I expect from community:
- Be Kind
